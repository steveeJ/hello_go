config.json is tracked, but with invalid login values - 
we don't want to commit valid login values!

.gitignore and .git/info/exclude don't ignore tracked files, so
the following has been run to enable changing login values while ignoring the tracked file:
git update-index --assume-unchanged examples/config.json
